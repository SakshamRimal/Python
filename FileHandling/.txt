why we need file handling concept?
whnever we run the program we have Ram and Disk so whenever we want to run the program it will be loaded 
in main memory 
for eg function add():
then it will be first stored in main memory Ram but once we close the program data is gone 
but what if we want to store the data permnanently 
So if we want to store the data permnanently we use File to store that data permanently in the disk 
also if we want to store large amount of data then we can fetch the file from the harddisk 
Thus we use file handling for these reason 

File is the sequence of byte where we store data permanently on disk 
So, managing these operation is known as file handling 

How to implement File handling then?
Types of file:
   # Binary Files
   # Text Files

Operation on files:
   #open 
   #write
   #read
   #close 

Open: 
   file_object = open('file_name' , "mode")

What are these mode:
     # r  ----- read mode
     # w  ----- write mode
     # a  ------ append mode
     # r+ ------ read and write mode (first read and then write)
     # w+ ------ read and write mode (first write and then read)
     #a+ ------- read and append mode

Now,programming
